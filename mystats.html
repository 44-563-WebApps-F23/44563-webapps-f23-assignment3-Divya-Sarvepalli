        <h3>Favorite food: Maggie</h3>
        <p>Honestly, I'm not into junk foods but this instant noodles changed my mind and makes me to crave for it all the time when I was lazy to prepare any food. Not to mention, it tastes awsome unlike any other instant foods. Best part is we can add our own flavours or ingredients like egg, chicken, vegetables etc. to match our tastes. It will be prepared in just few minutes and satisfies my food cravings so I prefer it. But not all the time though.</p>
