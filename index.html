        <h6> Favourite Vacation Spot : Ooty </h6>
        <p>I love Ooty because of the <b>climate</b>. It always have the low temperature and the <b>nature</b> was so soothing, <b>greenary</b> after the rain was the best. Also, it's famous for <b>Tea Estates</b> where the original and natural tea is prepared. Serving a fresh hot tea with cool climate makes a perfect evening.</p>
